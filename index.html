              <a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://weavegrid.com">WeaveGrid</a>
              and was hired
              to own Developer Experience and Release Pipeline initiatives within the
              five-person Foundations team.
              The team originally included two Engineers focused on
              Infrastructure (System Reliability and Security, respectively),
              two Engineers focused on the Data Warehouse, and myself as the DevX Engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
              My primary focus is to supplement the Engineering team's knowledge of
              Docker Compose container-based services,
              Kubernetes namespace management,
              Helm deployment charts,
              Terragrunt-backed infrastructure,
              CircleCI deployment workflows powered by an internal orb,
              Grafana monitoring and alerting dashboards,
              OpenSearch (formerly Kibana) event logging,
              and Postgres/Redis database access.

              remain as reliable and performant as possible,
              with the understanding that ongoing interruptions from the Engineering team

              Additionally, as a formal member of the Infrastructure team,

              Before my first 1-on-1 with my manager, who was on paternity leave when I joined,
              I began extracting all scriptable knowledge from our Confluence documentation
              and built a series of automated onboarding scripts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shortly after that first meeting, I rewrote and reorganized the majority
              of our Confluence docs to create a linear onboarding path,
              logically group resources, and improve long-term reference clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              While Engineering Managers typically expected onboarding to take 3 to 10 days,
              my 40-minute setup allowed new hires to complete multiple pull requests
              within their first week.

              Senior, long-tenured Engineers, and both the outgoing and incoming
              Directors of Engineering, publicly praised the impact of this work.

              In the same spirit of removing recurring friction, I hacked together smart
              TablePlus connection bundles to eliminate the timesink of repeatedly
              debugging database connection issues.

              I consolidated access to all Staging, Production, Kubernetes, and Local
              databases into a single, password-protected resource.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using TablePlus' Command Line field, I invoke scripts from "hidden" fields
              that leverage symlinks and dotfiles, with optional full logging for
              debugging.

              Engineers with active AWS SSO authentication are automatically
              granted permissioned access to Staging and Production environments.

              For Kubernetes, I open SSH tunnels through our bastion as background
              processes to provide transparent access to their test namespaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Almost immediately, database connection issues disappeared,
              freeing me up to improve other areas of our developer experience.

              My first major cross-team collaboration began when end-to-end Cypress tests
              were being reintroduced after a 7-month hiatus.

              These UI-based tests had been disabled due to long runtimes that slowed
              release pipelines made worse by rampant failures and, even more frustratingly,
              test flakes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although my proposed solution initially met hesitation,
              I implemented test tagging to identify and isolate problematic tests.

              By tagging tests as @nonblocking, @flaky, and @disabled,
              I drastically reduced runtimes and improved test reliability.

              While others debated the usefulness of test tagging,
              I handled the majority of the heavy lifting, cutting
              the average test time from 8+ minutes to 4.0 minutes and dropping the
              flake rate from ~70 per week to just 2 every three weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, the burden on the UI team became far more manageable and
              aligned with the Director of Engineering's post-incident request to ensure
              basic functionality was always reliably tested before release.

              Even after eliminating noisy integration tests, deployment-related failures
              continued to plague 56% of our CircleCI pipelines on jobs that were
              expected to be stable.

              We defined "stable" as jobs unrelated to unit or integration tests and
              strictly tied to deployment and operational workflows.

              By tracking down a series of race conditions, I was able to eliminate all
              failures from these jobs for a 29-day deployment window.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once reliability was locked in, I shifted focus to velocity, cutting the average
              deployment duration by 73% from 29 minutes to 7 minutes and 45 seconds.

              This also dropped P95 Production deployment time from 36 minutes to 11 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              With reliability and speed in place, release trains stopped being interrupted
              by new release candidates and Engineers no longer faced 3-hour delays to ship.

              Instead, Engineers are regularly @mentioning teammates to approve release
              candidates so they could continuously deliver fixes and features to Production.

              As developer experience improved and release safety was strengthened
              through queued deployments to Production,
              I shifted focus to efforts aimed at improving security posture
              and system resilience like EKS upgrades and enabling Redis Cluster Mode.

              While EKS upgrades were relatively low-touch beyond updating a few
              Kubernetes add-ons, the Redis migrations were more involved.
            </p>
            <p>
              Redis migrations required auditing service code across teams,
              deploying pre-migration changes,
              defining new Kubernetes environment variables,
              creating load tests to validate stability,
              and delivering new dashboards with integrated runbooks to support future
              debugging efforts.

              Due to compliance requirements, shifting workloads,
              and scheduled paid time off, I was tasked mid-sprint with creating an
              automated, cross-service uptime tracking project to surface reliability
              gaps in our Production system.

              These checks needed to run outside of our internal infrastructure,
              span all Engineering teams, and alert on failures.

              Within a few days, I delivered a working setup using CircleCI Triggers and
              Cypress Cloud testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The design allowed each team to quickly integrate tests from their own
              repositories while consolidating runtime data into a single, isolated repository.

              Test runs were properly queued with timeouts to avoid overlap,
              alerted to Slack as a first line of defense,
              and exported metrics for easy downstream consumption before handing ownership back to
              the Engineer responsible for the project.

              Throughout my time, I continuously gather feedback from our team of 27
              Engineers to improve Infrastructure-related surfaces, ranging from
              local development with Docker Compose and Kubernetes developer tooling
              to documentation in Confluence and developer experience metrics.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also focus on release safety, stability, and velocity across our
              CircleCI and Cypress Cloud pipelines based on daily pipeline activity
              instead of solely formal requests.

              Because this work is driven organically and prioritized based on visible,
              high-impact needs, escalation to the Project Manager is rarely necessary.

              Based on survey results, improvements to Developer Experience within my

            <p>During periods of low customer engagement at <a href="https://thelastpickle.com/">The Last Pickle</a>, I
              often engaged with T-Mobile's Cassandra teams. Questions around monitoring
              details and alert resolution were common across Developer teams and the broader Infrastructure team. When
              T-Mobile chose an org-level Grafana instance to monitor their applications and infrastructure, they asked
              TLP to
              create Cassandra-centric dashboards that could be used across their teams.

              A coworker and I delivered
              domain-specific dashboards separated into clearly labeled rows containing full runbooks in all important
              panels'
              tooltips. We also configured alerts with detailed resolution guides and matching threshold explanations in
              each
              alert message. These <a

            <p>During an engagement with a new inbound customer late on a Thursday, I diagnosed
              and repaired an 800-node multi-region database cluster experiencing split-brain networking issues where
              about
              five versions of the schema were simultaneously live causing a percentage of failed read and write
              requests.

              After the CEO and Principal Architect diagnosed their issues for the better half of an afternoon and got
              ready
              to sign off, I joined and took the lead on the call. Within 30 minutes of listening to their symptoms, we
              began
              upgrading off JDK 1.7.0, synced NTP clocks with the same time server pool, and set alerts for duplicate
              schemas, resolving their issue in time for a slow rollout over the weekend.

              Over three months, we delivered heavily detailed usage, data model, and operations runbooks and helped
              them implement
              most
              solutions. These runbooks contained debugging guides, indicators of potential high load scenarios, ideal
              metric
              thresholds, and actionable early warning and alert messages. From this collection of runbooks, we
              distilled two

            <p>After repeatedly asking for the same information across customers of various
              cluster sizes, I began automating my metrics collections using a simple script. This script was then
              productized
              as the goto method for collecting diagnostics for any new clients. It was soon used as a snapshot when our
              customers were experiencing issues and before making major operational changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              A companion script was
              quickly added to
              automate
              the markdown generation of most runbook sections, including extracted values, command line output
              snippets, templatized data modelng sections, and
              personalized sections depending on cluster health.
            </p>
            <p>
              The collection script and diagnostics generator were
              productized at The Last Pickle and transferred to DataStax after they acqui-hired the team. This tooling
              is
              still used by the Support team at DataStax in 2024.</p>

              I was part of the three-person Architecture team consisting of the Chief
              Architect, the Senior Data Scientist, and myself. Under minimal guidance from the Chief Architect, I
              developed
              an asynchronous API written in Python which relied on Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB, and Postgres
              that
              increased processing speed by more than 3x while reducing costs by 50%.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the completion of the project,
              hourly
              jobs were completed in under 18 minutes at half the cost with reliable data replication and transparent
              denormalization.
            </p>
            <p>
              These optimizations were made possible due to an asynchronous data object that handles
              denormalization, client-side retries, metrics, hydration, and transactions. The design heavily
              followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIC7QW62-Tw">Volatility-based Decomposition</a> planning
